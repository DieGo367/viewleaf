===== Park Trails Project Use Cases =====
Diego Gonzalez

The idea for this project is an app that will allow the user to discover park trails, view information on them, and plan trips around them.

The main use cases are as follows. The user should be able to:

- Search for trails by name, or by various filters such as area (park), city, state, length, elevation gain, "popularity" (as provided by the dataset), etc.
- View the information for a given trail. All the previously mentioned attributes, as well as possibly a description pulled from an external source and some photos as taken by users.
- Post comments about a trail on its page, as well as view the comments of others
- Post photos of a trail by attaching them to comments.
- Upvote or downvote comments for comment quality
- Make "trail plans", which are collections of trails a user may be planning to visit.
- Add or remove trails to plans from their page
- View, edit, and delete trail plans from their page
